# How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
# •	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances
#     to get favorite results.
# •	The Powerball game includes two parts.
# o	Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly
#     from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20).
# o	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly
#     from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
# •	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers,
#     your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
# Here is one of the examples when I run my code.

# today's powerball winning number:
#    3 5 18 12 5 1
#Your lucky number:
#    2 14 19 0 3 2
#   Try again

# Every time you run your program/page, your  would display the winning numbers, and your lucky numbers,
# and the result respectively. For example, after I rerun my program several times, I got this one:

# Grading: Today’s Powerball Winning Numbers (27 points)
