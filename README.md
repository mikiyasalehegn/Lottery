## How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
### •	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances
###     to get favorite results.
### •	The Powerball game includes two parts.
### •	Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly
###     from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20).
### •	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly
###     from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
### •	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers,
###     your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.

## Here is one of the examples when I run my code.
### today's powerball winning number:
###    3 5 18 12 5 1
### Your lucky number:
###    2 14 19 0 3 2
###   Try again

### Every time you run your program/page, your  would display the winning numbers, and your lucky numbers,
### and the result respectively. For example, after I rerun my program several times, I got this one:

## Grading: Today’s Powerball Winning Numbers

###     results in zero points.
### •	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (11 points) - hard code results in zero points.
### •	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10. - hard code
###     results in zero points.
